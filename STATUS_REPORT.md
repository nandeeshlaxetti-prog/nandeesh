## 🔧 Issues Found

### Issue #1: Vercel Build Failures ⚠️
**Problem:** Webpack cannot resolve `@vercel/kv` module during build
**File:** `apps/nandeesh-web/app/api/cases/storage/route.ts`
**Impact:** New deployments failing
**Severity:** Medium

**Current Behavior:**
- Local dev works (uses memory cache)
- Older deployments work
- New deployments fail at build time

**Solution Required:**
1. Install `@vercel/kv` as dependency, OR
2. Use dynamic import with webpack magic comments, OR
3. Create separate implementation for Vercel

- ✅ **Git Repository:** Code is saved and synced
- ✅ **API Endpoints:** All working locally
- ✅ **Memory Cache:** Cases are being saved (19 cases in cache)
- ✅ **CNR Lookup:** Server-side lookup working

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix `@vercel/kv` Import Issue:**
